## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced AI Reasoning System

**Deep 4-Stage Analysis Process:**
1. **DEEP ANALYSIS**: Context, intent, urgency, disaster factors
2. **INITIAL ANSWER**: Structured response with knowledge base insights
3. **3-ITERATION REVIEW**: Accuracy → Clarity → Practical application
4. **FINAL PRESENTATION**: Clear, actionable, safety-focused

### 2. Comprehensive Knowledge Base

- **15 chunks with embeddings** (100% coverage)
- **450+ question variants** for natural language matching
- **Sub-100ms semantic search** with gte-small model
- **Psychology & Shelter topics** fully covered

### 3. Realistic Disaster Question Database

**33 carefully crafted questions** representing real user needs:
- 7 Immediate urgency (life-threatening)
- 12 Urgent (serious threats)
- 9 Important (planning/prevention)
- 5 Routine (education)

### 4. Self-Testing Infrastructure

- `disaster_questions` table with test tracking
- `question_test_results` for quality metrics
- `get_undertested_questions()` function
- Foundation for continuous improvement
