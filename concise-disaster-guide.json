They last seconds to minutes and cause ground shaking, building collapse, and aftershocks that can continue for months.\n\n**What To Do:**\n‚Ä¢ **DROP** to hands and knees immediately\n‚Ä¢ **COVER** head and neck under sturdy furniture\n‚Ä¢ **HOLD ON** and stay put until shaking stops\n‚Ä¢ If in bed, stay there and cover head with pillow\n‚Ä¢ If outdoors, move away from buildings to open area\n‚Ä¢ If driving, pull over away from structures and stay inside\n‚Ä¢ DON'T run outside - falling debris is deadly\n‚Ä¢ DON'T use elevators\n‚Ä¢ DON'T stand in doorways - not safer than other spots\n\n**After It Stops:**\n‚Ä¢ Wait 60 seconds before moving - let your brain reorient\n‚Ä¢ Check for injuries and treat bleeding first\n‚Ä¢ Expect aftershocks - get back to safety if shaking resumes\n‚Ä¢ Check for gas leaks (smell/hissing), electrical damage (sparks), structural damage (cracks)\n‚Ä¢ Turn off gas and electricity if damaged\n‚Ä¢ Use stairs only, never elevators\n‚Ä¢ Listen to battery radio for updates",

      "content": "üåÄ **HURRICANES**\n\nHurricanes are massive rotating storms with winds 74+ mph. Storm surge (ocean pushed ashore) causes 90% of deaths, not wind. Categories 3-5 are major hurricanes with catastrophic damage.\n\n**What To Do:**\n‚Ä¢ **Evacuate if ordered** - storm surge is unsurvivable\n‚Ä¢ If in evacuation zone A, B, or C - you must leave\n‚Ä¢ DON'T stay for Category 3+ hurricanes\n‚Ä¢ Board windows and bring in all outdoor items\n‚Ä¢ Fill vehicles with gas NOW - stations lose power\n‚Ä¢ Withdraw cash - ATMs will fail\n‚Ä¢ Fill bathtubs and containers with water\n\n**If Staying (ONLY Cat 1-2, NOT in surge zone):**\n‚Ä¢ Go to interior first-floor room away from windows\n‚Ä¢ Stay there during entire storm\n‚Ä¢ Keep radio on for updates\n\n**During The Eye:**\n‚Ä¢ DON'T go outside when winds stop\n‚Ä¢ Eye is temporary calm - winds return from opposite direction within 30 minutes\n‚Ä¢ Most injuries happen during eye\n\n**After Storm:**\n‚Ä¢ Wait for official all-clear\n‚Ä¢ Avoid ALL standing water - electrified from downed lines\n‚Ä¢ Never touch downed power lines\n‚Ä¢ Don't drive through water - 6 inches sweeps vehicles away\n‚Ä¢ Use generator OUTSIDE only - carbon monoxide kills indoors",

EF5 tornadoes cause total destruction.\n\n**What To Do:**\n‚Ä¢ **Take shelter immediately** when warning issued\n‚Ä¢ Go to basement southwest corner if you have one\n‚Ä¢ No basement? Interior room on lowest floor (bathroom, closet, hallway)\n‚Ä¢ Get in bathtub if it's sturdy, cover with mattress\n‚Ä¢ Stay away from windows and exterior walls\n‚Ä¢ Get low, cover head and neck with arms\n\n**If In Mobile Home:**\n‚Ä¢ LEAVE immediately to permanent shelter\n‚Ä¢ Mobile homes are death traps - they disintegrate in strong tornadoes\n‚Ä¢ Find substantial building or designated shelter\n\n**If Caught Outside:**\n‚Ä¢ Lie flat in ditch or low area\n‚Ä¢ Cover head with hands\n‚Ä¢ Watch for flash flooding in low areas\n‚Ä¢ DON'T hide under highway overpass - wind speeds increase, creates deadly debris tunnel\n\n**Warning Signs:**\n‚Ä¢ Dark greenish sky\n‚Ä¢ Large hail\n‚Ä¢ Loud roar like freight train\n‚Ä¢ Rotating cloud base\n\n**After Tornado:**\n‚Ä¢ Watch for downed power lines and gas leaks\n‚Ä¢ Don't use flames or electrical switches if you smell gas\n‚Ä¢ Check on neighbors who may be trapped",
