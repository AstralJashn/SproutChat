## Disaster Scenario Awareness

### Mental State Considerations
The AI understands users may be:
- Panicked, exhausted, injured, or in shock
- Unable to process complex information
- Experiencing cognitive impairment from stress
- In need of simple, repeatable, memorable guidance

### Resource Awareness
AI assumes:
- Limited tools, time, and supplies
- No specialized equipment
- Varying environmental conditions
- Different skill levels (novice to experienced)

### Urgency Classification
Responses adapt to urgency level:
- **Immediate**: Life-threatening, seconds/minutes matter
- **Urgent**: Serious threat, hours matter
- **Important**: Planning/prevention, days matter
- **Routine**: Knowledge building, educational

---

## Realistic Disaster Question Database

### Purpose
33 carefully crafted questions that reflect **actual user needs, confusion points, and urgent concerns** during disasters.

### Question Breakdown

**By Urgency:**
- Immediate: 7 questions (life-threatening situations)
- Urgent: 12 questions (serious threats)
- Important: 9 questions (planning/prevention)
- Routine: 5 questions (education)

**By Complexity:**
- Simple: 10 questions (straightforward answers)
- Moderate: 18 questions (nuanced guidance)
- Complex: 5 questions (multi-faceted scenarios)

**By Disaster Type:**
- Psychological crisis/preparedness
- Shelter emergency/technique
- Exposure emergency
- Compound crisis (multiple threats)
- Urban survival
- General education

### Example Questions

**Immediate Urgency:**
- "I'm hyperventilating and can't think straight. What do I do RIGHT NOW?"
- "I'm soaking wet and starting to shiver uncontrollably. What do I do first?"
- "It's getting dark and the temperature is dropping fast. I have 30 minutes of daylight. What's my priority?"

**Urgent Urgency:**
- "I haven't slept in 48 hours and I'm making stupid mistakes. Should I rest even though we need to keep moving?"
- "Wind is ripping through my shelter. Should I rebuild or try to reinforce it?"
- "Everyone in our group is arguing about what to do next. How do I prevent this from falling apart?"

**Complex Scenarios:**
- "I'm alone, it's freezing, I'm exhausted, and I can't stop crying. I don't know what to do first."
- "Our shelter collapsed in the night. It's -10Â°F. Two people are hurt. What's the order of operations?"
- "Someone in our group is making dangerous decisions but won't listen. What do I do?"

## Core AI Principles

### 1. DEEP CONTEXT
Analyzes full conversation history, not just keywords. Understands intent behind questions.

### 2. CLARIFY AMBIGUITY
Asks for details when questions are unclear rather than making assumptions.

### 3. LOGICAL REASONING
Uses deduction from knowledge base and principles. Avoids guessing or speculation.

### 4. CONSISTENCY
Aligns with prior responses in the conversation. Builds on previous exchanges.

### 5. PROACTIVE CORRECTION
Identifies conflicts in information and suggests the best path forward.

### 6. ADMIT LIMITATIONS
Clearly explains when human experts are needed. Recommends specific types of professionals.

### 7. MAXIMIZE UNDERSTANDING
Every response must truly help the user. Focused on actionable guidance.

### 8. CONTINUOUS LEARNING
Adapts based on feedback within the session. Refines approach with each interaction.

### 9. SAFETY FIRST
Life-preserving information takes absolute priority. Never compromises on safety.

## Response Structure

### Information Hierarchy
1. **Immediate Safety**: Critical actions to preserve life
2. **Stabilization**: Securing situation and preventing deterioration
3. **Next Steps**: Practical actions for improvement
4. **Context**: Explanation of why and underlying principles
5. **Alternatives**: Backup options if primary method isn't feasible
6. **Common Mistakes**: Warnings about typical errors
7. **Escalation**: When to seek human expert help

### Communication Style
- **Concise but thorough**: No unnecessary words, but complete information
- **Practical examples**: Real-world scenarios and applications
- **Step-by-step**: Clear sequential instructions when appropriate
- **Principle-based**: Explains underlying concepts for transferable learning
- **Empathetic**: Acknowledges stress and emotional state
- **Confident**: Instills calm even in crisis situations

---

## Rule of 3s Framework

The AI emphasizes the survival priority hierarchy:

1. **3 minutes without air** - Breathing/airway is always priority #1
2. **3 hours without shelter** (in extreme conditions) - Exposure kills quickly
3. **3 days without water** - Hydration critical for cognitive and physical function
4. **3 weeks without food** - Nutrition important but less immediately urgent

This framework guides all priority-based recommendations.
